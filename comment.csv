To paraphrase [Matt Welch](http://mattwelch.com/old/2001_11_04_lettersarchive.html#6944345):

* Economic aid: suggests we implicitly support what the regime is up to.  see Egypt, Indonesia
* Humanitarian aid: allows the regime to continue to neglect its own people, when the aid itself doesn't get stolen.  See Nigeria, Afghanistan
* Trade: Legitimizes the regime and gives it a financial lever to use on us.  Opportunity for large corporations to profit from the repression.  See Saudi Arabia, China.
* Economic Sanctions: Make the situation worse.  
* Military Attack: Iraq.  Iraq.  Iraq Iraq Iraq.  Really, the less said, the better.
* Doing Nothing: We can't just sit here while they kill or brutalize thousands of people.  Are we racist monsters?  See: Sudan, Rwanda, Bosnia.",2,2,,1138817684,1473820884,_c16rs,0

None of the victims are of any particular religion, unless you count the extermination of Eastern European Jews by Nazis.

None of the perpetrators of these crimes were of any particular religion, unless you argue that Marxism, Marxism-Leninism, or ""Communism"" are religions.  Hence, none of these crimes have really been perpetrated by ""fundamentalists"" -- although they were definitely carried out by fanatics.

All of this is a rather roundabout way of saying, when you talk about the United States ""using fundamentalism as an ideological tool against ... progressive nationalism and communism"", or wax regretful over the many crimes of Christian fundamentalists in the US, or talk up the import of protecting ""The West"" from Muslim fundamentalists in the Persian Gulf, that we all have to keep these things in the proper perspective.

I really suspect that we don't want to be on the 'countries that don't do math and science' end of this equation.  This whole 'international division of labor' things seems like a bad idea, really.  It seems that we have people who have a variety of skills, interests, and abilities in the US (or any nation for that matter) and to say ""Oh, you're good at math and science, well you'd best move to China or India because those are the places that specialize in those skills, here we do marketing"" is a very bad idea.  If you believe in this international division of labor then it basically means that in any nation you'll have large numbers of people who won't be able to 'fit' into a highly specialized society which has no room for their skills.  It also means that if some disaster comes up where you can't communicate or trade with other regions for a time, your country will not be able to get essential goods or services.

The whole system and society are geared towards power wealth.

These sources count for 58% of emissions, and 96% of emissions from electricity sectors.

9405,c6416,,isaacharley,reddit.com,"I gave this one points (because I find the subject very interesting and think others should think about it as well), but I think the author, and perhaps the professor interviewed paint an incomplete picture of the challenges of learning Chinese. 

First, it is *very* important to note that ""Chinese"" is at best an incomplete definition of the languages currently spoken in the people's republic of china and by the diaspora of Han Chinese around the world. Even the separation into Mandarin (Putonghua) and Cantonese (Guangdonghua) doesn't do justice to the variety of spoken Chinese throughout China. 
Whereas Mandarin is the official language of China, based largely on the local language in Beijing, the capitol, Cantonese is spoken in Hong Kong and Guangdong province and traditionally has been the language of the Chinese diaspora, due to the importance of the South-east of China in international trade. That said, there are many different local variants of Chinese, which when spoken are mutually unintelligible. Useful comparisons to the structure of the Chinese languages can be drawn from the relation of the Romance languages (Italian, French, Spanish, Portuguese, Romanian, Occitan, etc.) to Latin. [All of these languages share some degree of mutual intelligibility] Another is the case of Arabic, where there are many varieties of spoken Arabic (Iraqi, Morrocan, Egyptian, Syrian, etc.) and literary Arabic, which is common throughout, based on the qur'anic version of Arabic. 

That said, Chinese, like any language is very easy for children to learn how to speak. It is, nonetheless, a difficult writing system to master, even for chinese-born native speakers. [http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0824810686] 
For adult foreigners, however, it poses a bit more of a challenge. 
The article points out that writing and tonality are the two main hurdles to overcome. 
I generally agree, however, there are a number of phonemes ( sounds) which simply do not occur in English (insert your local language here), which to occur in Chinese. These pose a challenge as well. 
Tonality is either a huge problem (my father is tone-deaf;I don't believe he could ever become fluent in Chinese) or just takes a lot of discipline/practice (remembering the mapping between sound/tone combinations and meaning; Fortunately context, aids in this process)
The writing system is not so bad, though it requires *a lot* of practice to maintain one's skill. To my surprise, I find it is more similar to Western writing systems, than I ever would have suspected. (In the process of this discovery, I feel I have learned very much about the relation between written and spoken language)
Finally, I find the comment by Dr. Weightman on Grammar at the end particularly misleading. Chinese grammar seems transparent to English speakers, particularly those who have studied a language where modifiers are tacked on to the end of words, to modify tense, declension, etc. (read: Finnish) This is due to the lack of inflection in Chinese - that is changes in word order lead to changes in meaning.

I am not too far along in my study of Chinese language, but I find the difficulty is often over-sold. (except to the tone-deaf, who should never try to learn tonal languages) That's not to say that it is a piece of cake. There are some mental hurdles - tonality, bizzare sounds, a different writing paradigm, and an unfamiliar approach to grammar. Once those are managable at a basic level, I find that dilligence and practice are all that are required.

Of course they don't have democracy - it's antithesis to current or historical Islam! Of course women aren't treated as equals - it's part of the function of women having separate roles in Islam! However, it's foolhardy to believe that innovation is only possible in a democracy - look at the USSR and China. 

Perhaps democracy is optimal - I'd certainly rather live in a democratic state than a theocratic one. I'd certainly rather live in a capitalist society than a planned economy. However, it seems silly to blame the problems of the Arab world on this alone.

Likewise, the idea of blaming colonialism is silly. In sub-saharan Afric, it makes more sense. The continent was sliced up in such illogical ways and was decimated for four centuries. Their woes are the culmination of four centuries of tragedy. However, most of the Arab world had a rather short stay of colonialism. So they lost a little land to Israel - they've had more than enough money to cure the woes that such offenses brought.

&gt;There is no population problem. Population growth is the result of the plunging death rate and increasing life expectancy worldwide. That is progress.

Unless birth rates drop further, unsustainable progress.

&gt;The growth in human population has been more than met by increases in the production of food and other resources, including energy. Famine in the 20th century is a political rather than an ecological phenomenon. We are not running out of resources, and real prices of raw materials are lower than ever before. Only the price of labor consistently rises. Population growth and economic growth are compatible: Between 1776 and 1975, while the world's population increased sixfold, real gross world product rose about 80-fold. People are net resource producers.

People and technology magnify the economic value of raw materials or use resources available to them to provide further services.  These raw materials, however, are physically limited.  Current estimates state maximum populations of about 10-15 billion, if every inch of arable land were seeded with the best available GM crops.  However, if we wish to preserve such luxuries as global biodiversity and occasional animal protein, much of this land will need to be reserved for other purposes.  The time to address these problems is now, not in 40-60 years' time when such limits may be reached.

Poor nations have many difficulties, among them trade restrictions by richer nations and predatory financial arrangements that lead to corrupt, thuggish regimes that impoverish their people (and thereby eliminate any competitive threat they might pose to industrialised nations.)  It is certainly the case that improved economic welfare leads to a drop in fertility, but many poor nations have immediate and pressing problems meeting their people's basic physical needs, due to a harsh climate, limited technology or both.  In addition, 'Market Liberalism' is often a smokescreen for the introduction of large-scale corporate cronyism that chiefly benefits first-world industrial magnates and often results in gross human rights violations.  Nike springs to mind.

There were, indeed, terrible adverse side-effects to population restrictions in China and India.  And while it is true that economic prosperity should be the most efficient means to address population growth, many couples in developing countries insist on large families as a means of economic insurance against old age and child mortality- and what is rational for the individuals in such a case is irrational for the society at large.  This is *exactly* what government exists to address.  Many social ills are the result of self-reinforcing chains of factors that cannot be tackled by addressing any link in isolation, be it trade barriers or cultural attitudes.

&gt;The late Roger Revelle of Harvard University (whom Gore claims as a mentor) estimated that Africa, Asia, and Latin America alone, simply by using water more efficiently, could feed 35 to 40 billion people..

http://dieoff.org/page99.htm

""A few years ago, for example, a group of Catholic bishops, misinterpreting a thought exercise by Roger Revelle (1976), asserted that Earth could feed 40 billion people (Anonymous, 1988); various social scientists have made estimates running as high as 150 billion (Livi-Bacci, 1989). These assertions are based on preposterous assumptions, and we do not deal further with them here.""

&gt;""More population means more creators and producers, both of goods along established production patterns and of new knowledge and inventions.""

Current knowledge and inventions are more than adequate to address the problems of developing nations, but they lack the resources to take advantage of these.

&gt;Actually, natural resources do not exist at all. All resources are manmade.

Until we can defy the law of conservation of matter and energy, their supply remains limited.

The things that I do not like about Chomsky are: 

1) He is constantly puffed up as a great intellectual, but never submits any articles to peer-reviewed journals. I admit that while I am a polyglot, and am not a serious linguist, in my time working with linguistics I have found his work receives more adulation that seems appropriate. While he has had significant influence, especially in the U.S., his importance in linguistics gets puffed up because of his other political writings, and he engages in far too much self adulation - all this irritates me, but it is not enough to justify hating him. 

2) His rhetoric is incredibly grating after a while. His criticisms of US foreign policy while sometimes well founded, often verge on hysterics, and get extremely tedious after a few books. His repeat assertions that the US is at its root Fascist or Nazi, and that the US needs to go through 'denazification,' and his repeated comparison of the U.S. policy to that of Nazi Germany are rhetorically repulsive. On another rhetorically repulsive note, in the same way that he blathers on about his own self importance in his linguistic writings, he does the same in his political works. 

3) While I did have some reservations about the invasion of Afghanistan, they were focused on a concern that we would not follow through with rebuilding, and a concern that we might not adequately push for ensuring that human rights were respected by the new regime. I did not want to see the Taliban left unabated. Chomsky not only opposed any form of military action, but claimed that the US would starve millions of Afghanis, and would essentially engage in a form of genocide. 

4) Chomsky actually sided with the Republicans in criticizing the NATO intervention in Kosovo to stop the genocide occurring there. 

5) He has in the past defended Pol Pot, Maoist China, and other regimes that I find reprehensible. 

6) Chomsky has been repeatedly incredibly intellectually dishonest in his political writings when it served him. One example is in writing about UN ambassador Daniel Moynahan. He was no angel, but Chomsky selectively misquoted him, and attributed false quotes to him to make him appear to be someone who delighted in Nazi tactics.

This is an incomplete list, but these taken together along with other concerns (I run into egregious stuff when I read his works, but I explicitly try to avoid him as much as possible now) are why I hate him.  He, like Michael Moore, serves the left poorly.

26570,c3rdz,,Random,reddit.com,"Hmmm. Where to start.

First of all, written Chinese has very little to do with spoken Chinese. Mandarin is a spoken language. The written 'equivalent' does indeed have thousands of characters and a rich history (see, for example, the excellent 'Swallowing Clouds' by A. Zee for some of the history intertwined with cooking tidbits) but the spoken language is quite different.

When travelling in China last year we noticed there were significant differences in speaking patterns and word use between Beijing and, for example, Kunming in Sechuan. Mandarin is an 'attempt' at a universal chinese spoken language but it has only been partially succesful - much like there were very different versions of English until the mass media began wiping Cockney and Franglais and... off the map. 

Learning to speak the language is very very hard since the phonemes are quite different. However, you could learn to write it without speaking a word, since they are not phonetic / symbolic equivalents like English or most IndoEuropean languages are. Learning to write it is apparently even harder (my kids and wife learned it, I gave up) because as you say of the thousands of characters with highly specific contextual semantics.

The article was talking largely about the spoken language; you could learn to speak it and use the Pinyin phoneticized language or a variant to type it without using traditional characters.

9405,c6416,,isaacharley,reddit.com,"I gave this one points (because I find the subject very interesting and think others should think about it as well), but I think the author, and perhaps the professor interviewed paint an incomplete picture of the challenges of learning Chinese. 

First, it is *very* important to note that ""Chinese"" is at best an incomplete definition of the languages currently spoken in the people's republic of china and by the diaspora of Han Chinese around the world. Even the separation into Mandarin (Putonghua) and Cantonese (Guangdonghua) doesn't do justice to the variety of spoken Chinese throughout China. 
Whereas Mandarin is the official language of China, based largely on the local language in Beijing, the capitol, Cantonese is spoken in Hong Kong and Guangdong province and traditionally has been the language of the Chinese diaspora, due to the importance of the South-east of China in international trade. That said, there are many different local variants of Chinese, which when spoken are mutually unintelligible. Useful comparisons to the structure of the Chinese languages can be drawn from the relation of the Romance languages (Italian, French, Spanish, Portuguese, Romanian, Occitan, etc.) to Latin. [All of these languages share some degree of mutual intelligibility] Another is the case of Arabic, where there are many varieties of spoken Arabic (Iraqi, Morrocan, Egyptian, Syrian, etc.) and literary Arabic, which is common throughout, based on the qur'anic version of Arabic. 

That said, Chinese, like any language is very easy for children to learn how to speak. It is, nonetheless, a difficult writing system to master, even for chinese-born native speakers. [http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0824810686] 
For adult foreigners, however, it poses a bit more of a challenge. 
The article points out that writing and tonality are the two main hurdles to overcome. 
I generally agree, however, there are a number of phonemes ( sounds) which simply do not occur in English (insert your local language here), which to occur in Chinese. These pose a challenge as well. 
Tonality is either a huge problem (my father is tone-deaf;I don't believe he could ever become fluent in Chinese) or just takes a lot of discipline/practice (remembering the mapping between sound/tone combinations and meaning; Fortunately context, aids in this process)
The writing system is not so bad, though it requires *a lot* of practice to maintain one's skill. To my surprise, I find it is more similar to Western writing systems, than I ever would have suspected. (In the process of this discovery, I feel I have learned very much about the relation between written and spoken language)
Finally, I find the comment by Dr. Weightman on Grammar at the end particularly misleading. Chinese grammar seems transparent to English speakers, particularly those who have studied a language where modifiers are tacked on to the end of words, to modify tense, declension, etc. (read: Finnish) This is due to the lack of inflection in Chinese - that is changes in word order lead to changes in meaning.

I am not too far along in my study of Chinese language, but I find the difficulty is often over-sold. (except to the tone-deaf, who should never try to learn tonal languages) That's not to say that it is a piece of cake. There are some mental hurdles - tonality, bizzare sounds, a different writing paradigm, and an unfamiliar approach to grammar. Once those are managable at a basic level, I find that dilligence and practice are all that are required.
